The are concrete mechanisms that cause researchers to prefer data privatising.

* data owners gaining best publications
* perhaps fearing data misuse
* spending time in potentially unproductive adversarial process. 

benefits of open data:

* facilitating alternative research, reproducibility, reusablility, and repeatability (see https://github.com/volodymyrss/reproducibility-motivation)

Researchers (especially those without permanent job, but not only) experience these causes, and feel not understood of when formally pressured.

*In most if not all discussed contexts, mechanisms drive researchers into practices which, although benefit them (or their collaborations) directly, harm collective knowledge progress.*

And it is great that this is recognized by the agencies.

But when it is presented as self-obvious it is not addressed why these causes are valid, but do not, in fact, lead to consistent long-term benefit.
is how to counteract very concrete benefits gained by hiding data.

Ideally, agencies need to make specific steps. And in part they do
make the effort to explain, sometimes, in some detail
